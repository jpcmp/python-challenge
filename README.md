homework 3
I am having some issues to push changes through the github desktop. It is taking too long to commit the changes, although it says it changed in github desktop, when I enter my github repository I dont see any updates. I don't know how long it will take so, to make sure you have the correct files I created this Final folder and uploaded it manually.

Sorry the inconvinience.

Joao.
